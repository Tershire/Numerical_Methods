# Numerical-Methods
codes written by applying learned knowledge earned in the course AE4803 Numerical Methods &amp; Algorithm at Georgia Tech

These are codes that I have written by myself while taking Dr. Saleh's course.

AE 4803 course deals with numerical computation algorithms,
and the contents have really helped me to understand not only how computers are powerful but also how different they are
as opposed to analytical methods.

Some topics introduced are...
- Numerical errors
- Newton-Raphson method
- Gauss-Seidel method
- Lagrange polynomials
- Splines
- Runge-Kutta method
- Shooting method
